1.  Sample of OpSim Psf cutout scripts.  

The files pars and image.fits.gz in sample_psfs are an OpSim input catalog and output image.
makelibrary can be used to create the psf library and index files needed for all of the
following scripts

2.  Sample Great3, GalSim, measurement, and analysis runs

The file run_params is a sample file which drives all of the scripts.

A subdirectory called base is created and run_params is copied to it.

The runbase scripts can be used to call runGreat, runGal, runMeas, and runAnal,
or these scripts can be run separately.  

    -- runGreat sets up the GalSim output directory, soft links the required psf libraries,
       and creates the yaml files for galsim
    -- runGal runs GalSim on the created yaml files.
    -- runMeas runs the selected measurement algorithm.  Note that both processShearTest.py
       and run_params must be set up with the correct algorithm setup and field names.
    -- runAnal runs statistics on the individual measurement catalogs, and stores a 
       statistical summary of each run in anal.cat.fits.  This BaseCatalog is cumulative.

3. runPlot is used to plot the results from runAnal run over all of the runs with various
   filter, seeing, and shear settings.  It requies the output of runAnal. A sample of this
   file is in sample_anal.
