1.  Sample of PhoSim Psf cutout scripts.  

The files pars and image.fits.gz in sample_psfs are an PhoSim input catalog and output image.
makelibrary can be used to create the psf library and index files needed for all of the
following scripts

2.  Sample Great3, GalSim, measurement, and analysis runs

The file run_params is a sample file which drives all of the scripts.
The runbase script can be used to call the four shear test stages: great3, galsim, measure, analyze.

    runbase base_directory [-3] [-g] [-m] [a]

A subdirectory called base_directory is created and run_params is copied to it.  Python code is then
called (runShear.py) to run each of the selected stages:

    -- -3 uses great3 to set up the GalSim output directory, soft links the required psf libraries,
       and creates the yaml files for galsim
    -- -g runs GalSim on the created yaml files.
    -- -m runs the selected measurement algorithm.  Note that both processShearTest.py
       and run_params must be set up with the correct algorithm setup and field names.
    -- -a runs statistics on the individual measurement catalogs, and stores a 
       statistical summary of each run in anal.cat.fits.  This BaseCatalog is cumulative.
