#  Settings for analysis code (the alogrithm itself is in processShearTest.py)
#  The shape field can be either an ellipticity measurement or a moments
#  The field name provided is the name minus either an _e1/e2 or _xx/xy/yy
#  The sigma field is usually and error in the ellipticity measurement.
#  If sigma is estimated from another measurement, sigma_signal_field is required
